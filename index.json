Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals in a large cohort (n = 967) of healthy young adults, the present study maps neuronal and functional complexities estimated by using MSE of BOLD signals and BOLD phase coherence connectivity, respectively, at various levels of the brain’s organization. The functional complexity explores patterns in a higher dimension than neuronal complexity and may better discern changes in brain functioning. The leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method is used to predict fluid intelligence using neuronal and functional complexity MSE values as features. While a wide range of scales was selected with neuronal complexity, only the first three scales were selected with functional complexity. Fewer scales are advantageous as they preclude the need for long BOLD signals to calculate good estimates of MSE. The presented results corroborate with previous findings and provide a baseline for other studies exploring the use of MSE to examine changes in brain function related to aging, diseases, and clinical disorders.

Initial studies assumed this resting-state functional connectivity (FC) to be stationary in nature, but recent studies have modeled these activities as a dynamic network. Dynamic spatiotemporal models better model the brain activities, but are computationally more involved. A comparison of static and dynamic FCs was made to quantitatively study their efficacies in identifying intrinsic individual connectivity patterns using data from the Human Connectome Project. Results show that the intrinsic individual brain connectivity pattern can be used as a ‘fingerprint’ to distinguish among and identify subjects and is more accurately captured with partial correlation and assuming static FC. It was also seen that the intrinsic individual brain connectivity patterns were invariant over a few months. Additionally, biological sex identification was successfully performed using the intrinsic individual connectivity patterns, and group averages of male and female FC matrices. Edge consistency, edge variability and differential power measures were used to identify the major resting-state networks involved in identifying subjects and their sex.","tags":[],"title":"A Comparison of Static and Dynamic Functional Connectivities for Identifying Subjects and Biological Sex Using Intrinsic Individual Brain Connectivity","type":"publication"}]
